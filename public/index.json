Personnel Services, addressing inefficiencies in their outdated system. The solution integrated key features such as dashboards, messaging, notifications, user management, and onboarding kits. By introducing a modern dark mode design and streamlining workflows, the platform significantly enhanced recruitment efficiency and improved communication across branches. Date Client Role 2023-Present L.M. Personnel Services UX/UI Design Systematic Dashboard Overview L.M. Personnel Services is a leading human resources company focused on connecting the right candidates to the right positions. However, their recruitment tracking system was outdated, fragmented, and inefficient. My goal was to design a unified platform that streamlined the recruitment process and enhanced user experience for both company staff and candidates.\nThe Challenge The company\u0026rsquo;s existing tools were siloed, which made it difficult to efficiently manage the recruitment pipeline. Key issues included:\nLack of a unified platform for tracking candidates. Cumbersome user interfaces for managing worker communication. Inefficient onboarding processes. A need for modern, visually appealing dark mode designs. The Solution I designed a centralized recruitment management platform that integrates all key functions into one cohesive system:\nDashboard: A central hub with real-time updates on recruitment activities. Messages: Communication tools for company staff and branch workers. Notifications: Timely updates for both recruiters and candidates. Workers List: A comprehensive view of all current and prospective employees. User Management: Tools for controlling access and permissions across the system. Kit Management: A dedicated feature to streamline onboarding processes with pre-prepared kits for new recruits. Uploading files Messages Notifications Design Process Research: Collaborated with the L.M. Personnel Services team to understand their workflows and user needs. Prototyping: Created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, emphasizing usability and functionality. Dark Mode Design: Implemented a sleek and modern dark mode interface to align with client preferences. Testing and Iteration: Conducted user testing with company staff and made iterative improvements based on feedback. The Result The newly designed system revolutionized recruitment management at L.M. Personnel Services:\nStreamlined workflows for tracking and onboarding recruits. Improved communication across branches. Enhanced recruiter efficiency, resulting in faster candidate placements. A visually appealing interface that modernized the company’s digital presence. Interested in tackling complex challenges together?

This project involved research, design, prototyping, and iterative development to create a more efficient and accessible educational ecosystem. Date Client Role 2023 Rambam Medical Center UX/UI Design Students and Candidates Initial Research and Analysis Understanding the Problem Context: The existing system relied heavily on offline methods, with documents stored in binders and communication primarily conducted via phone calls. The system in place was outdated and barely usable, leading to inefficiencies in managing students, classes, and lecturers. Research: The project began with meetings with school staff to understand their workflows, documents, and workspace. This research phase provided critical insights into the existing challenges and highlighted the need for a modern, digital solution. Key Insights Offline methods were time-consuming and prone to errors. The old system lacked the functionality needed for efficient student and class management. There was a significant opportunity to improve communication and document management through digital tools. Ideation and Design Process Initial Concept The goal was to design an LMS that would streamline administrative tasks, improve communication, and provide real-time data insights. This involved creating user-friendly interfaces for managing students, classes, and lecturers, all while ensuring the system aligned with the institution’s needs. Wireframing and Prototyping Prototyping: A prototype was developed using Axure to provide a tangible representation of the search experience. This prototype served as a crucial tool for visualizing the design, exploring user interactions, and testing the overall user experience. Design Language: The prototypes were crafted using the system\u0026rsquo;s existing design language, ensuring consistency and familiarity for users. Design Iterations Through user feedback and iterative testing, the design evolved to better meet user needs. Each iteration incorporated improvements in search relevance, user engagement, and system usability, ensuring the final design was intuitive and efficient. Solution Implementation Final Design After multiple iterations, the final design was implemented. This advanced LMS platform featured real-time data insights, efficient course management, and seamless communication channels across all processes of admission.
