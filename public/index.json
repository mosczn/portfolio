A streamlined experience designed exclusively for the CEO of the Israeli Knesset. This project transformed his workspace by merging multiple screens previously displaying unmanaged meeting video feeds into a single, intuitive dashboard that puts everything he needs at his fingertips.\rDate Client Role 2023 The Knesset UX/UI Design Calendar wireframe\rThe Challenge The CEO’s workspace was cluttered with multiple software tools, files, and screens tracking ongoing meetings, making it hard to get a clear, unified view of the Knesset’s agenda. This lack of cohesion made decision-making less efficient and limited overall operational visibility.\nMy Role As the UX/UI Designer, I created wireframes and designed visual interfaces for key modules like Room Capacity, Calendar, and Search Results. Using Figma and Agile methodologies, I worked collaboratively to ensure the design was both functional and visually aligned with the CEO’s workflow.\nThe Process Analysis \u0026amp; Discovery Through a thorough visual audit of the CEO\u0026rsquo;s existing workflow setup, I identified critical operational inefficiencies:\nMultiple screens displaying uncontrolled video feeds required constant attention Calendar information spread across various software tools created information gaps No centralized system for accessing historical meeting recordings Search functionality fragmented across multiple platforms This analysis phase revealed that the CEO\u0026rsquo;s workspace wasn\u0026rsquo;t just inefficient. it was actively hindering strategic oversight of Knesset operations.\ngraph TD\rsubgraph \"After Solution\"\rA1[Single Dashboard View] --\u003e|Integrated Interface| A2[Access All Information]\rA2 --\u003e|Unified Search| A3[Find Relevant Content]\rA3 --\u003e|Complete Overview| A4[Make Informed Decisions]\rend\rsubgraph \"Before Solution\"\rB1[Monitor Multiple Screens] --\u003e|Switch Focus| B2[Check Different Calendars]\rB2 --\u003e|Context Switch| B3[Search in Multiple Systems]\rB3 --\u003e|Miss Information| B4[Make Decisions with Incomplete Data]\rB4 --\u003e|Repeat| B1\rend\rstyle B1 fill:#ffcccc\rstyle B2 fill:#ffcccc\rstyle B3 fill:#ffcccc\rstyle B4 fill:#ffcccc\rstyle A1 fill:#ccffcc\rstyle A2 fill:#ccffcc\rstyle A3 fill:#ccffcc\rstyle A4 fill:#ccffcc\rDesign Approach Rather than conducting traditional user research (which wasn\u0026rsquo;t feasible given project constraints), I drew upon:\nIndustry best practices for executive dashboard design Modern interface patterns from leading streaming platforms Enterprise calendar system design principles Established information architecture patterns for complex data systems This research-backed approach ensured that despite time constraints, the design would be grounded in proven solutions.\nDesign Process The design process focused on three core principles:\nConsolidation: Bringing multiple data streams into a single, coherent interface Control: Giving the CEO precise control over video feeds and information display Clarity: Ensuring critical information is immediately accessible and actionable Key Design Decisions Rooms\u0026rsquo; Capacity Module\nImplemented both daily and weekly views to support different planning scenarios Used color coding to quickly communicate room availability status Designed consistent layouts between single and multi-room views to reduce cognitive load Calendar Interface\nCreated three distinct views (month, week, day) to balance overview with detail Integrated video feed controls directly into calendar events for immediate access Maintained visual hierarchy to highlight the most important information Search Experience\nDeveloped a unified search interface that clearly differentiates between event types Implemented robust filtering options to quickly narrow down results Created distinct visual treatments for events versus meeting videos to speed up recognition Prototyping and Iteration Without access to user testing, I focused on:\nCreating high-fidelity prototypes in Figma to validate interaction patterns Building a comprehensive design system to ensure consistency Documenting edge cases and potential usage scenarios Working closely with developers to ensure feasibility of proposed solutions The Solution The final design delivers a unified dashboard that transforms how the CEO manages and monitors Knesset operations:\nCentralized Control\nSingle interface for all video feed management Integrated calendar and scheduling tools Unified search across all content types Enhanced Visibility\nReal-time room capacity monitoring Multi-view calendar options Comprehensive search functionality Streamlined Workflow\nReduced context switching between tools Faster access to critical information More efficient meeting management The Result The redesigned dashboard streamlined the CEO’s daily workflow by bringing multiple applications together into one easy-to-use interface.
