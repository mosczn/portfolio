Workers List: A comprehensive view of all current and prospective employees. User Management: Tools for controlling access and permissions across the system. Kit Management: A dedicated feature to streamline onboarding processes with pre-prepared kits for new recruits. Uploading files Messages Notifications Design Process Research: Collaborated with the L.M. Personnel Services team to understand their workflows and user needs. Prototyping: Created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, emphasizing usability and functionality. Dark Mode Design: Implemented a sleek and modern dark mode interface to align with client preferences. Testing and Iteration: Conducted user testing with company staff and made iterative improvements based on feedback. The Result The newly designed system revolutionized recruitment management at L.M. Personnel Services:\nStreamlined workflows for tracking and onboarding recruits. Improved communication across branches. Enhanced recruiter efficiency, resulting in faster candidate placements.

Date Client Role 2023-2024 HolistiCyber UX/UI Design Sage Dashboard Challenge Companies face an ever-growing number of sophisticated cyber threats. Cybersecurity leaders (CISOs) struggle to manage these threats effectively due to inconsistent task naming, limited visibility into system activity, and a lack of tools for budgeting security expenses.\nMy Role I collaborated with cybersecurity professionals to design a system tailored to companies’ needs. My focus was on creating tools that improved decision-making, streamlined processes, and provided clarity in the complex realm of cyber defense.\nProcess Research Conducted interviews with CISOs and company stakeholders to understand pain points and operational needs. Analyzed workflows to identify inefficiencies in task management and budget planning. Prototyping Designed a Side Updates Panel for real-time visibility into system activity. Developed a ChatGPT-Powered Search Tool to retrieve relevant results despite inconsistent task naming. Built an Expense Calculator to estimate and manage the costs of cybersecurity initiatives. Iterated prototypes, ensuring they addressed real-world challenges faced by companies. Solution Key Features:\nReal-Time Updates: A Side Updates Panel for dynamic monitoring of system activities. Intelligent Search: ChatGPT-powered search interpreted user queries to find tasks regardless of naming conventions. Expense Calculator: A tool to calculate the costs of security measures, helping companies plan budgets effectively. Tailored for Companies: Designed to support the unique demands of businesses managing complex cyber defense plans. Results Enhanced Awareness: Real-time updates improved visibility into critical system events. Search Efficiency: Simplified task management, saving time and reducing user frustration. Informed Decision-Making: The Expense Calculator helped companies allocate resources effectively. User Satisfaction: Positive feedback from CISOs and stakeholders highlighted the system’s usability and impact. Context This system was designed in collaboration with HolistiCyber, a company revolutionizing cyber defense plans with a combination of nation-state grade expertise and advanced AI capabilities.\nReflection This project emphasized the importance of designing tools that adapt to the complexity of modern cyber defense. By understanding the needs of companies and their cybersecurity leaders, I was able to deliver a system that made a real impact on their ability to manage threats and resources.\nInterested in tackling complex challenges together?

This project involved research, design, prototyping, and iterative development to create a more efficient and accessible educational ecosystem. Date Client Role 2023 Rambam Medical Center UX/UI Design Students and Candidates Initial Research and Analysis Understanding the Problem Context: The existing system relied heavily on offline methods, with documents stored in binders and communication primarily conducted via phone calls. The system in place was outdated and barely usable, leading to inefficiencies in managing students, classes, and lecturers. Research: The project began with meetings with school staff to understand their workflows, documents, and workspace. This research phase provided critical insights into the existing challenges and highlighted the need for a modern, digital solution. Key Insights Offline methods were time-consuming and prone to errors. The old system lacked the functionality needed for efficient student and class management. There was a significant opportunity to improve communication and document management through digital tools. Ideation and Design Process Initial Concept The goal was to design an LMS that would streamline administrative tasks, improve communication, and provide real-time data insights. This involved creating user-friendly interfaces for managing students, classes, and lecturers, all while ensuring the system aligned with the institution’s needs. Wireframing and Prototyping Prototyping: A prototype was developed using Axure to provide a tangible representation of the search experience. This prototype served as a crucial tool for visualizing the design, exploring user interactions, and testing the overall user experience. Design Language: The prototypes were crafted using the system\u0026rsquo;s existing design language, ensuring consistency and familiarity for users. Design Iterations Through user feedback and iterative testing, the design evolved to better meet user needs. Each iteration incorporated improvements in search relevance, user engagement, and system usability, ensuring the final design was intuitive and efficient. Solution Implementation Final Design After multiple iterations, the final design was implemented.
