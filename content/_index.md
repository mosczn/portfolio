<p class="intro">
My name is Moshe and for the past 8 years, Iâ€™ve been dedicated to creating and designing seamless user experiences. Specializing in UX/UI design for complex systems, websites, and applications, I thrive on bridging the gap between functionality and aesthetics. My passion lies in crafting intuitive, user-centric designs that are both visually compelling and highly efficient.
