## The Challenge
L.M. Personnel Services, a leading human resources company, faced significant challenges in their recruitment processes due to an outdated and fragmented system. The lack of a unified platform resulted in inefficiencies in tracking candidates, communicating with staff, and onboarding new recruits. Key pain points included cumbersome user interfaces, manual processes, and the need for a modernized digital solution with dark mode design to align with client preferences.  

<br></br>

## My Role
As the UX/UI designer for the project, I was tasked with redesigning and streamlining the recruitment management system. My responsibilities spanned research, wireframing, prototyping and delivering a final design that addressed both functional and aesthetic requirements.  

<br></br>

## The Process 

### Research and Analysis
The project began with in-depth discussions with L.M. Personnel Services staff to understand their workflows and challenges. This research phase highlighted inefficiencies in tracking and communication and revealed opportunities to streamline the recruitment pipeline through a centralized platform.  

### Conceptualization
The design concept centered on creating a unified platform that integrated all recruitment-related functionalities. Features such as candidate tracking, user management, and onboarding tools were identified as priorities to enhance efficiency and user experience.  

### Wireframing and Prototyping
Low-fidelity wireframes were developed to outline the platform's structure, followed by high-fidelity prototypes that focused on usability and functionality. Prototypes were iteratively tested with users to ensure alignment with their needs and preferences.  

### Dark Mode Design
Given the client’s request, a sleek dark mode design was implemented, providing a modern and visually appealing user interface while maintaining functionality and accessibility.

- **Dashboard**: A real-time overview of recruitment activities.
