# Delivering real-time insights for strategic governance.

{{< lead >}}
A streamlined experience designed exclusively for the CEO of the Israeli Knesset. This project transformed his workspace by merging multiple screens previously displaying unmanaged meeting video feeds into a single, intuitive dashboard that puts everything he needs at his fingertips.

## The Challenge
The CEO’s workspace was cluttered with multiple software tools, files, and screens tracking ongoing meetings, making it hard to get a clear, unified view of the Knesset’s agenda. This lack of cohesion made decision-making less efficient and limited overall operational visibility.

<br></br>

## My Role
As the UX/UI Designer, I created wireframes and designed visual interfaces for key modules like Room Capacity, Calendar, and Search Results. Using Figma and Agile methodologies, I worked collaboratively to ensure the design was both functional and visually aligned with the CEO’s workflow.

## The Process

### Analysis & Discovery
Through a thorough visual audit of the CEO's existing workflow setup, I identified critical operational inefficiencies:
- Multiple screens displaying uncontrolled video feeds required constant attention
- Calendar information spread across various software tools created information gaps
- No centralized system for accessing historical meeting recordings
- Search functionality fragmented across multiple platforms

This analysis phase revealed that the CEO's workspace wasn't just inefficient. it was actively hindering strategic oversight of Knesset operations.

### Design Approach
Rather than conducting traditional user research (which wasn't feasible given project constraints), I drew upon:
- Industry best practices for executive dashboard design
- Modern interface patterns from leading streaming platforms
- Enterprise calendar system design principles
- Established information architecture patterns for complex data systems

This research-backed approach ensured that despite time constraints, the design would be grounded in proven solutions.

### Design Process
The design process focused on three core principles:
1. **Consolidation**: Bringing multiple data streams into a single, coherent interface
2. **Control**: Giving the CEO precise control over video feeds and information display
3. **Clarity**: Ensuring critical information is immediately accessible and actionable

#### Key Design Decisions

**Rooms' Capacity Module**
- Implemented both daily and weekly views to support different planning scenarios
- Used color coding to quickly communicate room availability status
- Designed consistent layouts between single and multi-room views to reduce cognitive load

**Calendar Interface**
- Created three distinct views (month, week, day) to balance overview with detail
- Integrated video feed controls directly into calendar events for immediate access
- Maintained visual hierarchy to highlight the most important information

**Search Experience**
- Developed a unified search interface that clearly differentiates between event types
- Implemented robust filtering options to quickly narrow down results
- Created distinct visual treatments for events versus meeting videos to speed up recognition

### Prototyping and Iteration
Without access to user testing, I focused on:
- Creating high-fidelity prototypes in Figma to validate interaction patterns
- Building a comprehensive design system to ensure consistency
- Documenting edge cases and potential usage scenarios
- Working closely with developers to ensure feasibility of proposed solutions

## The Solution
The final design delivers a unified dashboard that transforms how the CEO manages and monitors Knesset operations:

1. **Centralized Control**
   - Single interface for all video feed management
   - Integrated calendar and scheduling tools
   - Unified search across all content types

2. **Enhanced Visibility**
   - Real-time room capacity monitoring
   - Multi-view calendar options
   - Comprehensive search functionality

3. **Streamlined Workflow**
   - Reduced context switching between tools
   - Faster access to critical information
   - More efficient meeting management


<br></br>

## The Result
The redesigned dashboard streamlined the CEO’s daily workflow by bringing multiple applications together into one easy-to-use interface. This not only boosted efficiency and decision-making but also provided clearer insights into the Knesset’s agenda and improved management of ongoing meetings.
