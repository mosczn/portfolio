# Delivering real-time insights for strategic governance.

{{< lead >}}
A VOD-like experience created exclusively for the CEO of the Israeli Knesset. This project reimagined the CEO’s workspace by consolidating multiple screens—previously showing uncontrolled meeting video feeds—into a single, intuitive dashboard that puts control at his fingertips.

## The Challenge
The CEO’s workspace was fragmented, with different software tools, files and screens displaying ongoing meetings, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive view of the Knesset’s agenda. This disjointed setup hindered efficient decision-making and reduced overall operational insight.

<br></br>

## My Role
As the UX/UI Designer, I was responsible for designing the wireframes and visual interfaces for key modules such as the Rooms’ Capacity, Calendar, and Search Results. Working collaboratively with Figma while using Agile methodologies, I ensured that the design addressed both the functional and aesthetic requirements of the CEO’s unique workflow.

## The Process

### Research and Analysis
Initial discussions with the CEO and his team helped uncover critical pain points related to juggling multiple software tools and lacking a unified overview of meetings. A heuristic evaluation and competitive analysis of leading dashboard and calendar products informed the design direction, emphasizing the need for a consolidated, user-friendly interface.

### Ideation and Conceptualization
Inspired by modern calendar products and control panels, brainstorming sessions yielded a concept that merged video control, scheduling, and search functionalities into one cohesive dashboard. The goal was to simplify the user’s journey by centralizing all relevant information into a single interface.

### Prototyping and Testing
Interactive prototypes were developed in Figma, allowing the CEO and his team to experience the design early on. Iterative testing sessions provided valuable feedback, leading to refinements that enhanced usability, navigation, and overall responsiveness of the interface.

### Implementation
The final design was handed off to the development team along with comprehensive documentation and a custom design system. This facilitated a smooth transition from design to development and ensured consistency across all elements of the dashboard.

## The Solution
The resulting product is a centralized dashboard that delivers a VOD-like experience for meeting video feeds, combined with a dynamic calendar, advanced search capabilities, and real-time room capacity metrics. This integrated approach empowers the CEO to control his workspace efficiently, providing both an operational overview and the ability to manage video feeds seamlessly.

<br></br>

## The Result
The redesigned dashboard transformed the CEO’s daily workflow by consolidating multiple applications into a single, intuitive interface. This led to significant improvements in efficiency and decision-making, with enhanced clarity of the Knesset’s agenda and smoother control over ongoing meetings.

### Search Results

After extensive research and stakeholder interviews, I discovered that the CEO frequently relies on the search function throughout his day. By iterating through multiple prototypes, I developed this interface that clearly differentiates results—tailoring distinct elements for events and meeting videos to ensure rapid, efficient access to critical information.
