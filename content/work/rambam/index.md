## The Challenge

The existing administrative process relied heavily on offline tools.  
Student records were kept in physical binders, updates were handled over the phone, and information was often duplicated or lost between departments.

During research sessions with school staff, several issues kept repeating:

- Managing students and classes took more time than necessary
- Manual documentation increased the risk of mistakes
- Staff had no clear, real-time overview of students, courses, or lecturers
- Communication between departments depended on memory rather than systems

The need wasn’t for “more features”, it was for **clarity and reliability**.

---

## My Role

I led the UX/UI design process end to end.

That included:
- Researching existing workflows and constraints
- Translating offline processes into digital flows
- Designing and prototyping the LMS experience
- Iterating based on continuous feedback from staff

The focus throughout the project was usability and adoption, not novelty.

## The Process

### Research & Understanding the Reality

I spent time observing how the system actually worked day to day, not how it was described on paper.

This included:
- Sitting with staff while they handled student records
- Reviewing physical documents and forms
- Mapping how information moved between people and departments

The research made one thing very clear:  
**the system needed to reduce friction, not introduce new rules.**

#### Main Pain Points
- Time-consuming manual workflows  
- High risk of documentation errors  
- Fragmented communication  
- No single source of truth  

---

### Concept & Direction

The core idea was to create a single platform that:
- Centralizes student, class, and lecturer data
- Supports daily administrative work without training overhead
- Reflects existing mental models instead of fighting them

The LMS wasn’t meant to feel “innovative”, it was meant to feel obvious.

---

### Wireframing & Prototyping

Using Axure, I created interactive prototypes based on the institution’s existing design language.  
This helped staff focus on workflows and functionality rather than visual novelty.

The prototypes were used as discussion tools:
- to validate assumptions
- to surface missing scenarios
- to refine flows before visual design

### Iteration & Refinement

Design iterations were driven by real usage feedback.

Improvements focused on:
- Making actions easier to find
- Reducing steps in common tasks
- Improving clarity around student status and documentation
- Adding notifications where silence caused confusion

Each iteration aimed to remove friction rather than add functionality.

---

## The Solution

The final result was a centralized Learning Management System tailored to Rambam’s operational needs.

The system supports:
- Student profiles and documentation
- Course and module planning
- Communication between staff and students
- Lecturer scheduling and payroll coordination

All key information lives in one place and is accessible when needed.

## The Result

After introducing the LMS:

- Administrative workflows became faster and more reliable
- Communication between departments improved significantly
- Staff spent less time searching for information
- Errors caused by manual handling were reduced

Most importantly, the system replaced uncertainty with structure.

---

## Reflection

This project reinforced how impactful good UX can be in environments that are not traditionally digital-first.

By respecting existing workflows and focusing on clarity, the system became something staff could rely on and not another tool they had to adapt to.

If I were to continue this project, I would focus on long-term usage patterns and further simplify high-frequency tasks based on real usage data.
