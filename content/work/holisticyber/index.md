# Making Cyber Defense Easier to Reason About

{{< lead >}}
This project came out of working closely with cybersecurity professionals and trying to understand what actually slows them down in day-to-day decision making.  
The goal wasn’t to add more data, it was to make existing information easier to see, search, and act on.

## The Challenge

During early conversations with CISOs and security stakeholders, a few recurring frustrations kept coming up.

- Tasks were hard to find because naming conventions weren’t consistent.
- Important system updates were easy to miss, buried across different views.
- Budgeting for security initiatives often relied on rough estimates rather than clear calculations.

None of these issues were dramatic on their own, but together they created friction, uncertainty, and slower decision-making in moments where clarity really matters.

---

## My Role

I worked closely with cybersecurity professionals throughout the project, from early discovery through design iterations.

My role focused on:
- Understanding how security leaders think and work under pressure
- Translating complex workflows into interfaces that feel manageable
- Designing and refining features based on real operational needs

I was responsible for UX and UI design across the product.

## The Process

### Research

I started by listening.

Through interviews and workflow reviews with CISOs and stakeholders, I tried to understand:
- How they currently track tasks and system activity
- Where information gets lost or overlooked
- What makes budgeting conversations difficult or unclear

One thing became very clear:  
they weren’t asking for more features they were asking for less confusion.

---

### Prototyping & Iteration

Based on these insights, I explored several ideas and iterated closely with feedback from users.

#### Side Updates Panel
I designed a side panel that surfaces important system updates without interrupting the main workflow.  
The intention was simple: let users stay aware of what’s happening without constantly switching context.

#### Intelligent Search (ChatGPT-powered)
Because task naming was inconsistent, traditional search wasn’t reliable.  
The search experience was designed to focus on user intent, allowing people to find what they need even when terminology varies.

#### Cybersecurity Expense Calculator
To support planning and budgeting, I designed an expense calculator that helps estimate the cost of different security initiatives.  
This gave CISOs a clearer way to reason about trade-offs before committing resources.

Each feature went through multiple iterations to make sure it solved a real problem and didn’t add unnecessary complexity.

## The Solution

The final result was a cybersecurity planning platform centered around clarity.

- Real-time visibility into system activity
- Search that works even when data isn’t perfectly structured
- Budget insights that support more confident decisions

Everything was designed with the assumption that users are experienced professionals who don’t want to fight the interface to get answers.

---

## The Result

Feedback from CISOs and stakeholders showed clear improvements:

- Better awareness of ongoing system activity
- Less time spent searching for tasks
- More confidence when discussing costs and priorities
- An interface that felt easier to work with under pressure

The product helped teams focus more on decision-making and less on navigating the tool itself.

---

## Reflection

This project reinforced something I strongly believe in:  
good UX isn’t about simplifying reality it’s about helping people think more clearly within it.

Working on HolistiCyber pushed me to design for complexity without overwhelming the user, and to respect the mental load that cybersecurity leaders already carry.

With more time, I would continue validating the system through usability testing during real incident-response scenarios and further refine information prioritization.
