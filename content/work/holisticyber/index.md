## The Challenge  
Companies face an ever-growing number of sophisticated cyber threats. Cybersecurity leaders (CISOs) struggle to manage these threats effectively due to inconsistent task naming, limited visibility into system activity, and a lack of tools for budgeting security expenses.  

<br></br>

## My Role  
I collaborated with cybersecurity professionals to design a system tailored to companies’ needs. My focus was on creating tools that improved decision-making, streamlined processes, and provided clarity in the complex realm of cyber defense.  

<br></br>

## The Process  

### Research  
- Conducted interviews with CISOs and company stakeholders to understand pain points and operational needs.  
- Analyzed workflows to identify inefficiencies in task management and budget planning.  

### Prototyping  
- Designed a **Side Updates Panel** for real-time visibility into system activity.  
- Developed a **ChatGPT-Powered Search Tool** to retrieve relevant results despite inconsistent task naming.  
- Built an **Expense Calculator** to estimate and manage the costs of cybersecurity initiatives.  
- Iterated prototypes, ensuring they addressed real-world challenges faced by companies.

<br></br>

## The Solution  

**Key Features**:  
1. **Real-Time Updates**: A Side Updates Panel for dynamic monitoring of system activities.  
2. **Intelligent Search**: ChatGPT-powered search interpreted user queries to find tasks regardless of naming conventions.  
3. **Expense Calculator**: A tool to calculate the costs of security measures, helping companies plan budgets effectively.  
4. **Tailored for Companies**: Designed to support the unique demands of businesses managing complex cyber defense plans.  

<br></br>


## The Result 

- **Enhanced Awareness**: Real-time updates improved visibility into critical system events.  
- **Search Efficiency**: Simplified task management, saving time and reducing user frustration.  
- **Informed Decision-Making**: The Expense Calculator helped companies allocate resources effectively.  
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from CISOs and stakeholders highlighted the system’s usability and impact.  

<br></br>

## Reflection 
This system was designed in collaboration with **HolistiCyber**, a company revolutionizing cyber defense plans with a combination of nation-state grade expertise and advanced AI capabilities.
This project emphasized the importance of designing tools that adapt to the complexity of modern cyber defense. By understanding the needs of companies and their cybersecurity leaders, I was able to deliver a system that made a real impact on their ability to manage threats and resources.
