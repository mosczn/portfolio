Hi, I’m Moshe, a UX/UI Designer focused on designing clear, usable systems for complex products.

Over the past 8+ years, I’ve worked on web and mobile products across cybersecurity, healthcare, education, logistics, and real estate. I collaborate closely with product managers and developers, taking ideas from research and early flows all the way to high-fidelity UI and handoff.

I enjoy working on things that are a bit messy by nature: data-heavy dashboards, admin tools, and multi-step workflows. Turning them into experiences that feel structured and understandable. I also design and maintain design systems in Figma to help teams move faster without losing consistency.

Outside of work, I play guitar, experiment with side projects, and stay curious about tools, systems, and how people actually use them.
