Hi, my name is Moshe and I'm a Senior Product Designer specializing in user-centered, end-to-end design for complex B2B platforms.

With over 8 years of experience, Iâ€™ve led UX/UI design across web and mobile products in industries like cybersecurity, healthcare, education, logistics, and real estate. I work closely with product managers and developers to translate real user needs into intuitive, scalable solutions - from research and wireframes to high-fidelity UI and handoff. I also build and maintain design systems in Figma to ensure consistency and speed at scale.

Whether Iâ€™m simplifying messy workflows, improving data-heavy dashboards, or designing cross-platform flows, I approach every project with a balance of clarity, empathy, and strategy.

Outside of work, youâ€™ll find me playing guitar, experimenting with creative projects, and staying curious about new tools and trends in the design world.
