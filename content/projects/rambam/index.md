# Nursing Studies Management Platform

{{< lead >}}
My goal was to modernize the administration of nursing studies by transitioning from traditional paper-based processes to a dynamic Learning Management System (LMS) platform. This project involved research, design, prototyping, and iterative development to create a more efficient and accessible educational ecosystem.

## Initial Research and Analysis

### Understanding the Problem
- **Context**: The existing system relied heavily on offline methods, with documents stored in binders and communication primarily conducted via phone calls. The system in place was outdated and barely usable, leading to inefficiencies in managing students, classes, and lecturers.
- **Research**: The project began with meetings with school staff to understand their workflows, documents, and workspace. This research phase provided critical insights into the existing challenges and highlighted the need for a modern, digital solution.

### Key Insights
- Offline methods were time-consuming and prone to errors.
- The old system lacked the functionality needed for efficient student and class management.
- There was a significant opportunity to improve communication and document management through digital tools.

## Ideation and Design Process

### Initial Concept
- The goal was to design an LMS that would streamline administrative tasks, improve communication, and provide real-time data insights. This involved creating user-friendly interfaces for managing students, classes, and lecturers, all while ensuring the system aligned with the institution’s needs.

### Wireframing and Prototyping
- **Prototyping**: A prototype was developed using Axure to provide a tangible representation of the search experience. This prototype served as a crucial tool for visualizing the design, exploring user interactions, and testing the overall user experience.
- **Design Language**: The prototypes were crafted using the system's existing design language, ensuring consistency and familiarity for users.

### Design Iterations
- Through user feedback and iterative testing, the design evolved to better meet user needs. Each iteration incorporated improvements in search relevance, user engagement, and system usability, ensuring the final design was intuitive and efficient.
