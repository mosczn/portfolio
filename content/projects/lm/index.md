## L.M. Personnel Services: Transforming Recruitment Management  

{{< lead >}}
I designed a unified recruitment management platform for L.M. Personnel Services, addressing inefficiencies in their outdated system. The solution integrated key features such as dashboards, messaging, notifications, user management, and onboarding kits. By introducing a modern dark mode design and streamlining workflows, the platform significantly enhanced recruitment efficiency and improved communication across branches.

### **Overview**  
L.M. Personnel Services is a leading human resources company focused on connecting the right candidates to the right positions. However, their recruitment tracking system was outdated, fragmented, and inefficient. My goal was to design a unified platform that streamlined the recruitment process and enhanced user experience for both company staff and candidates.  

### **The Challenge**  
The company's existing tools were siloed, which made it difficult to efficiently manage the recruitment pipeline. Key issues included:  
- Lack of a unified platform for tracking candidates.  
- Cumbersome user interfaces for managing worker communication.  
- Inefficient onboarding processes.  
- A need for modern, visually appealing dark mode designs.  

### **The Solution**  
I designed a centralized recruitment management platform that integrates all key functions into one cohesive system:  
- **Dashboard**: A central hub with real-time updates on recruitment activities.  
- **Messages**: Communication tools for company staff and branch workers.  
- **Notifications**: Timely updates for both recruiters and candidates.  
- **Workers List**: A comprehensive view of all current and prospective employees.  
- **User Management**: Tools for controlling access and permissions across the system.  
- **Kit Management**: A dedicated feature to streamline onboarding processes with pre-prepared kits for new recruits.

### **Design Process**  
1. **Research**: Collaborated with the L.M. Personnel Services team to understand their workflows and user needs.  
2. **Prototyping**: Created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, emphasizing usability and functionality.  
3. **Dark Mode Design**: Implemented a sleek and modern dark mode interface to align with client preferences.  
4. **Testing and Iteration**: Conducted user testing with company staff and made iterative improvements based on feedback.  

### **The Result**  
The newly designed system revolutionized recruitment management at L.M. Personnel Services:  
- Streamlined workflows for tracking and onboarding recruits.  
- Improved communication across branches.  
- Enhanced recruiter efficiency, resulting in faster candidate placements.  
- A visually appealing interface that modernized the company’s digital presence.
