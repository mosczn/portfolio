## Challenge  
Companies face an ever-growing number of sophisticated cyber threats. Cybersecurity leaders (CISOs) struggle to manage these threats effectively due to inconsistent task naming, limited visibility into system activity, and a lack of tools for budgeting security expenses.  

## My Role  
I collaborated with cybersecurity professionals to design a system tailored to companies’ needs. My focus was on creating tools that improved decision-making, streamlined processes, and provided clarity in the complex realm of cyber defense.

## Process  

### Research  
- Conducted interviews with CISOs and company stakeholders to understand pain points and operational needs.  
- Analyzed workflows to identify inefficiencies in task management and budget planning.  

### Prototyping  
- Designed a **Side Updates Panel** for real-time visibility into system activity.  
- Developed a **ChatGPT-Powered Search Tool** to retrieve relevant results despite inconsistent task naming.  
- Built an **Expense Calculator** to estimate and manage the costs of cybersecurity initiatives.  
- Iterated prototypes, ensuring they addressed real-world challenges faced by companies.
